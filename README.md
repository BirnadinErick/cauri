# CAURI: documentation

**CAURI** is a Tauri-inspired but using C language. Why? Because.

this is just a tracking of what I learned about the workings of cauri.
this is to serve as a future reference. the documentation is not necessarily
technical and accurate. the descriptions explain what I perceive.

## TODO

- [x] window creation
- [x] load a view
- [x] communicate with backend
- [ ] navigate to another view
- [ ] navigate back
- [ ] create view workflow
- [ ] preserve view state during navigation
- [ ] how-to bootstrap a new project
- [ ] other-platform setup 

---

## Skeleton

```c
int main(void) {
    const webview_t window = webview_create((int)DEBUG, NULL);

    webview_set_title(window, "cauri-test");
    webview_set_size(window, 640, 480, WEBVIEW_HINT_NONE);

    webview_set_html(window, home);
    webview_run(window);

    webview_destroy(window);
    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
```

#### window handle creation

`webview_create` creates a webview window. takes 2 arguments. 

1. DEBUG: whether to allow debugging capabilities in the frontend
2. NULL: a window handle to embed the view.

> DEBUG: only works if the underlying view engine (e.g. GTK, WebView2 etc.) 
> supports *Inspect Element* functionality

#### decorating the window

following functions decorates the native window:

- webview_set_title: sets the title of the native window bar
- webview_set_size: sets the initial window size, user can resize the window

#### window content

`webview_set_html` sets the content inside to the *window*

#### initialize & bookkeeping

`webview_run` & `webview_destroy` are bookkeeping functions. there is nothing
more to say here.

## Communicating with backend

though webview allows 2-way communication, for now I am only focusing
on 1-way (i.e. Frontend -> Backend).

apart from skeleton, we need 3 things:

1. callback: a function to call; this will do the intended work
2. bind: let frontend know this callback exists
3. callback_arg: an argument struct that we need to give to the callback

### callback_arg

at least, we need to pass in the current webview window handle.

```c
typedef struct {
    webview_t window;
    // other stuff we need
} context_t;
```

### bind

we use the `webview_bind` method which takes 4 arguments in order:

1. w: the window handle
2. name: a name of the command to expose to the frontend
3. callback: the callback (as a function pointer)
4. arg: reference to the argument of the callback

```c
// context for binding
static long _count = 0;
context_t context = {.w = window, .count = _count};

// bind methods
webview_bind(window, "incr", increment, &context);
```

> the `name` will be what we would call in the frontend. (e.g. `window.incr()`).
> the bound method will be available in global *window* object in javascript

### callback

a function that we want to be called from the frontend. a *callback* takes 3
arguments:

1. id: an id of the request (to differentiate from multiple requests)
2. req: a JSON string that was passed from the frontend
3. arg: arg we passed during the binding (here, `context_t context`)

```c 
void increment(const char* id, const char* req, void* arg)
{
    context_t* context = (context_t*)arg;
    
    context->count += 1;
    char result[4] = {0};
    (void)sprintf(result, "%ld", context->count);
    
    webview_return(context->w, id, 0, result);
}
```

to let the frontend know of the result, we use `webview_return` as
`webview_return(context->w, id, 0, result)` (documentation WIP).

>[info] the *callback* can be also multithreaded. (documentation WIP);
